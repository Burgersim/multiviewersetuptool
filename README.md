# Multiverze Lay-Z

Setup Tool for Multiverze Multiviewer

## Description

This Tool can be used to more easily set up full rows of Streams on the UXA Multiviewer. This was made, because individually setting up streams took a long time and this tool does away with a lot of the manual parts, by setting up more than one channel with different resolutions, depending on our layout of the MV.
